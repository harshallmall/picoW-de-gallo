# picoW-de-gallo
Raspberry Pi Pico W and Pico H projects on MicroPython

## (1) Pico H LED
- Use Pico H and MicroPython to control an external LED and emit light.
- This project is a good starting point for MicroPython, and the simple, yet MicroPython friendly, Thonny IDE.
- Code is used to create an infinite loop and timed to control the on and off signal of the LED.

## (2) Pico H Button
- Use Pico H and MicroPython to control an external push-button aka momentary-switch.
- Code is used to program the Pico to control the GPIO pins on the breadboard and output a signal when the button is pushed.

## (3) Pico H LED Button
- Use Pico H and MicroPython to control both an external LED and push-button. A combination of (1) and (2)
- The button is pushed and controls the on and off signal of the LED.
- Code is used to program the Pico to control the GPIO pins on the breadboard to output a signal to the button.
- Code is used to program the Pico to control the GPIO pins on the breadboard to output a signal from the button to the LED.
- Code is used to output text to notify a user when the button is pushed and the LED is on or off.

## (4) Pico H LED Traffic Light
- Use Pico H and MicroPython to control three distinctly colored LEDs and emit light at specified times.
- Code is used to program the Pico to control the GPIO pins on the breadboard to output a signal to emit light from each LED.
- Code is used to create a loop that controls the time each LED is on and off in succession, a la a traffic light.
